# Now the script actually runs update_server ( which we just declared above ) with the id of the application ( 4020 is Garry's Mod ) and the name of the directory we want the server to be hosted from:

update_server 4020 "server_1"

# Add any additional servers here by repeating the above, but using a different directory name.

# Exit with status code 0 ( which means OK )
